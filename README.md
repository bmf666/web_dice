refactoring dice2 with flask

1. create dice rolling class (mock up in place, hard coded to rol 2d20)
    - update/convert/re-write dice2.py logic as a class
2. create Flask front end
    - ensure room to expand functionality (eg. character sheet support)
    - begin writing selenium tests
3. design and build character sheet class
4. expand Flask UI to support character sheets
